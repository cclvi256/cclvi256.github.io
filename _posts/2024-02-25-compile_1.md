## Elementary Steps Of Compiling

### Front End

- Preprossessing
- Lexical Analysis
  - Turn the preprocessed source code to the token stream.
  - Token: a tuple of a category code and a value.
  - Categories: Key words, Identifiers, Constants, Operators, Separators.
  - Each key word, operator, separator have its own category code; many identifiers share a same category code, and constants are categorised by type.
- Syntax Analysis
  - This step turns source code to an AST
- Semantic Analysis
  - Collect the identifiers by reading declarations.
  - Conduct semantic check.
    - Check double declarations, using of undeclared identifiers, 
- IR Generation
