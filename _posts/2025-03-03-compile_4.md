## Top-Down Parsing

Top-down parsing is based on **derivation**.

The 2 selection in the derivation is:

- Which non-terminal to expand
- Which production to use

Left-most derivation is one of the methods to derive a string from a grammar.
It always expands the left-most non-terminal in the current string.
There's right-most derivation, vice versa.

The reverse of left-most derivation is right-most reduction, vice versa.

### Recursive Descent Parsing

Recursive descent parsing is an automatic top-down parsing method, which gives a group of procedures to parse a string, each procedure corresponds to a non-terminal.
This is called a **recursive descent parser** since a non-terminal procedure may call other non-terminal procedures.
